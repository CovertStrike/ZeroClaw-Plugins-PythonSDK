# /pm-cleanup — Archive Completed Work

Archive completed work to reduce context noise when looking for active items.

1. Call `pm_status` for current state
2. Identify archive candidates:
   - **Done epics** where all linked stories are done/archived → archive epic + stories + tasks
   - **Done stories** not in active epics → archive story + tasks
   - **Completed sprints** older than 2 weeks
3. Present archive plan grouped by epic, show total count
4. **Ask for explicit approval before proceeding** — do not archive without user confirmation
5. Archive in order: tasks → stories → epics (via `pm_archive`)
6. Call `pm_reindex` to rebuild indexes
7. Summarize archived items
